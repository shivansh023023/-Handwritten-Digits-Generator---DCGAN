# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for MNIST

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate images similar to the MNIST dataset.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.
*   **TensorFlow:** A powerful open-source machine learning library used for building and training the neural networks.
*   **Keras:** A high-level API for TensorFlow, providing a user-friendly way to define and train models.
*   **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
*   **Matplotlib:** Used for plotting and visualizing the generated images.
*   **PIL (Pillow):** Used for image handling and manipulation, specifically for saving the generated images.
*   **imageio:** Used to create an animated GIF of the generated images over training epochs.
*   **tensorflow-docs:** Used for embedding the generated GIF in the notebook.

## Algorithms Used

*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** The core framework used in this project. GANs consist of two neural networks:
    *   **Generator:** Learns to create realistic data (in this case, MNIST-like images) from random noise.
    *   **Discriminator:** Learns to distinguish between real data (from the MNIST dataset) and fake data (generated by the Generator).
    The two networks are trained in an adversarial manner, where the Generator tries to fool the Discriminator, and the Discriminator tries to correctly identify real and fake data.
*   **Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs):** A specific architecture for GANs that utilizes convolutional layers in both the Generator and Discriminator. This architecture is well-suited for image generation tasks and helps to produce more stable training and better quality images. Key characteristics of DCGANs used here include:
    *   Using batch normalization in both the generator and discriminator.
    *   Using LeakyReLU activation in the generator and discriminator.
    *   Using transposed convolutional layers in the generator to upsample the image.
    *   Using convolutional layers with strides in the discriminator to downsample the image.
*   **Adam Optimizer:** An optimization algorithm used to update the weights of both the Generator and Discriminator networks during training.
*   **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss:** The loss function used to measure the performance of both the Generator and Discriminator.
